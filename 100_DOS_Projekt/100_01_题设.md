This is why we have RAG, which is a method for information retrieval for providing LLMs with the most up-to-date and domain-specific factual information! Retrieval Augmented Generation
• Semantic search technologies do all the work of knowledge base preparation
• Knowledge can be stored in different forms of databases such as vector or graph databases, and RAG systems differ according to in which format they represent the knowledge. (This is not the only aspect how RAG systems vary!)


• Observing the system
􀀀 Novel methods for monitoring system-specific information to be retrieved by RAG
􀀀 Getting the RAG Agent suggest solutions to your system-specific questions

• Suggesting actions considering the current state updated by the RAG Agent
􀀀 Respond non-generic, system-specific answers depending on the information retrieved by RAG Agent (i.e. suggesting how to open a new port on your particular machine, updating network drivers, etc.)
􀀀 Unprompted warnings from the agent

• Applying the suggestions directly
􀀀 Enabling RAG Agent to implement edits in the system (i.e. copying contents of one directory to another, deleting/editing particular files, etc.)
􀀀 Make your RAG Agent against errors?
